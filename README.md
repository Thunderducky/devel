# DEV.E.L
Developer Embedded Logger

## Goal
I created this library after wanting to have the
same scripting functionality in a lot of different areas. the goal is to make it easy to use just
like you would native code. You can even keep it
embedded in the library and use it if needed

## Scripts
# devel summon
- inject the basic source code into your project so you can customize it to work for you/get around any specific issue you are facing,
  - makes it easy to customize yourself per project
  - will confine itself to it's own folder, can be done with multiple folders

# Todo: Fix names and test code generator
